## Contribution to Bitrise (stack, tools & steps)

If you want to collaborate with us creating useful automation tools and steps please go to the [`contrib`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-contrib) repository and follow the guides. You can keep track of others' projects there as well.

## Our build steps collection

We maintain a [library of Bitrise build steps](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib), featuring all the [integrations](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations) we deploy to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

### Steps

A step is a script with a corresponding `yml` that conforms to the formatting and naming conventions of the StepLib.

You can find all our steps' `yml`s under [/steps](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib/tree/master/steps).

The repositories of the steps which we maintain and provide support for can be found by searching for [steps-](https://github.com/bitrise-io?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=steps-&type=&language=) in our [bitrise-io GitHub organization](https://github.com/bitrise-io), the newer ones in the [bitrise-steplib GitHub organization](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib), and the ones we maintain with the community in the [bitrise-community GitHub organization](https://github.com/bitrise-community).

We have most of our scripts written in `Go` and `bash`, but it's possible to write it in any language our machines have installed, like `Ruby` or `Node.js`.

> You can create a StepLib independently from Bitrise anytime, you will be able to use our CLI tools to maintain it, they are not tied to *our StepLib*.

## Bitrise CLI tools

Check out our [CLI's page](https://www.bitrise.io/cli) for a nice intro about why is it helpful to have Bitrise installed on your machine.

### `bitrise`

[The runner itself](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise), you can install it to your machine with Homebrew:

`brew update && brew install bitrise`

Or `curl` down the latest version with the help of our guide on the [releases page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases).

### `envman`

[`envman`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/envman) is our handy environment variable manager for switching between environment sets quick & easy.

### `stepman`

[`stepman`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman) is our solution to manage decentralized StepLib step (script) collections.

You will run into `stepman` directly most probably when you are sharing your own step to a StepLib.

>We have a collection of useful tools under the [bitrise-io](https://github.com/bitrise-io) account. Not all of them part of the Bitrise CLI family, but are connected to our technology.

All Bitrise CLI tools are written in Go.

## Stack

### OS X

We are working with [vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere), [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/) to virtualize, bootstrap and fire up the OS X build machines for builds on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

You can find all of our bootstrap scripts on the [OS X bootstrap GitHub page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap).

### Docker

We have a [base image](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-base) and an [Android version](https://github.com/bitrise-io/android) with pre-installed tools for Android builds.

>When a new version of a stack is available there will be a system report generated under the [system_reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports) folder of this repository.


### Request a tool to be pre-installed on a build machine

* For OS X you can create an issue or pull request at [`osx-box-bootstrap`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap)
* For our Docker based stack you can create an issue or pull request at:
    * [`bitrise-base`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-base), for generic tools and configurations (which are not related to Android)
    * [`android`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/android), for Android related tools and configurations
